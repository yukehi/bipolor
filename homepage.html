      <h3>is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and periods
         of abnormally elevated mood that last from days to weeks each.
         If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis,
          it is called mania; if it is less severe, it is called hypomania.
           During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic,
            happy, or irritable,and they often make impulsive decisions with
            little regard for the consequences.
            There is usually also a reduced need for sleep during manic phases.
             During periods of depression, the individual may experience crying
              and have a negative outlook on life and poor eye contact with others.
               The risk of suicide is high</h3>
